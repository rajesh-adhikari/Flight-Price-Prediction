# Flight-Price-Prediction

This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.
Created a tool that estimates Flight Prices to help users look for best prices when booking flight tickets.
Engineered features from the Departure Time, Date of Journey, to quantify the data and make it more understandable.
Optimized multiple Regression models using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
Built a client facing API using flask.

# File Descripitons
This Project is used to predict the flight prices. We will use Flight Price Dataset provided by Kaggle Flight Price. This dataset consists of 10683 records with 13 columns that explain about the flight in India by some Indian and foreign Airlines in 2019. We will analyze this dataset using Machine learning techniques in order to predict the flight ticket price based on the features provided in the columns of the dataset. We will begin the Data Science Life Cycle to process the data such as Cleaning the dataset, feature engineering, splitting dataset, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
